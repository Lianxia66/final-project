title : Analyzing the relationship between corporate profitability and carbon emissions to evaluate the economic impact of environmental policies.

The cost of carbon dioxide removal. 


1. Public Profit and Emission Database: This likely includes corporate profit data alongside their emission metrics, enabling you to analyze firm-level or sector-level profitability relative to emissions.  

2. Our World in Data (OWID) CO2 Dataset: This provides broader context on emissions trends globally, including historical data by country, sector, or energy type. It can help contextualize your firm-level analysis within larger geographic or policy trends.

Together, these datasets allow you to investigate how corporate emissions relate to broader environmental or economic policies, providing both micro (firm-level) and macro (country- or sector-level) perspectives. This alignment is especially suitable for policy-oriented research.
